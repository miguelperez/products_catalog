= Product catalog

Product catalog is a rails application that is intended to be a CMS for an online product catalog.

It has some nice features like:

* Admin area.
* Dashboard page with information related to users that visited the site.
* Banners creation.
* Easy customizable layout.
* Fully customizable contact form. Configured with a YML file.
* Configuration file.

== Installation

After fetching the project from XXXXXXXX, you would have to do your layout file or modify the default one.

I suggest creating a new one, for that just copy the file app/views/layouts/default.html.erb and rename it as
app/views/layouts/site.html.erb. After this you just need to add your css files, and you should be ready to go.
